The corrected CSS code uses an absolute path (if the image is in the root directory): 

```css
.my-element {
  background-image: url(/images/my-image.png);
}
```

Or, if the images directory is in the same directory as the CSS file, correct relative path should be used:
```css
.my-element {
  background-image: url('images/my-image.png');
}
```

If the image is in a subdirectory, adjust the path accordingly. For example, if the image is in `images/backgrounds/`, use the relative path `url('images/backgrounds/my-image.png')`.  Always double-check the path to ensure it accurately reflects the file system structure.
